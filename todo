 * Add instructions for building the code... It's the obvious things that get you in the end isent it?
 * Add some documentation
 * More tests would be good...
 * fix layout algorithm for xgml files
 * The "instructions.h" in callback really shouldent be there.
 * Remove the separate instructions for construction/exceution/destruction in callback... (maybe?)
 * Refactor the Behaviour Tree parser (and AST) into a library, leave code-generation stuff in btcomp
 * Add support for c-style enums to the parser and AST.
 * Break the pre-processor out into it's own parser, currently it's a &(%"#/"%Â¤"()#"& hack.
 * Optimize
 * Optimize
