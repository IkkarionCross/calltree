This is "calltree". 

Calltree is an implementation of Behaviour Tree's intended for use in game development.
It attempts to be as small as possible in needed run time, code size and memory overhead 
leaving the user more resources left over to do the actual heavy lifting.

Any code found in the '3rd' directory is supporting code that other's have written, in
some cases with very slight modifications done by me. This is only used during 
compilitaion (UnitTest++ for tests), in the "offline" tool 'btcomp' or in the example 
runtime 'cbrun'.

That code is not needed if you are only interested in using 'callback' in closed 
source binary where you want to use Behaviour Tree's built with btcomp.

The code currently builds with jam on Linux, needing Bison & Flex. It should be a 
no-brainer to get it to build and run under other platforms. I recomend getting 
mingw & msys for Bison & Flex.


Anyone who wants to get their hands dirty with the code all I can say is: 

get your hands dirty.
